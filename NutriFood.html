  <h3 id="Carbs">Carbohydrates</h3>
  <p> Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules and carbs are one of the three main nutrients found in food and drinks. The other two are proteins and fats. </p>
  <p> The body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. This is the main source of energy of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. </p>

  <p> These are the three main types of carbohydrates: </p>
  <p> Common Activities Are: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sugar - The most basic form of carbs and is usually found in sugary foods.</li>
    <li>Starches - These are a complex form of sugary molecules that your body breaks down to use for energy. The common examples are Bread, Pasta, and Cereal, but can also be found in vegetables. </li>

  <h3 id="Prot">Protein</h3>
  <p> The Proteins are the body's building blocks. Protein helps support every cell, from bone, to skin, hair, and muscle. It's primarily used for growth, health, and body maintenance. </p>
  <p> All of your hormones, antibodies, and other important substances are composed of protein. Your body doesn’t use protein as fuel unless necessary.</p>

<h3 id="FAV">Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
<p>Fruits and vegetables will positively have an effect on your exercise performance and will help in the long term results, because fruits and vegetables contain nutrients that boost your endurance and stamina. </p>

<p>It helps in tissue recovery and energy production that is essential in cardio and strength-based exercises, and certain nutrients can't be produced by the body so it's important to have a diet that has fruits and vegetables in order to deliver these nutrients to support regular physical activities. Eating multiple servings of fruits and vegetables each day will help improve your performance and help you feel and look better.</p>

<p>Not eating enough fruits and vegetables you may develop, muscle damage, decreased muscle strength, a weak immune system, and you get fatigued easily which will make exercise and physical activity seem draining. </p>

<p>That is why people say <b>FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE HEALTHY</b></p>


<h3 id="CAL">Calories</h3>
<p>Calories means a unit of measurement. </p>
<p>It's a way of describing how much energy your body could get from eating or drinking food and drinks. </p>
<p>You need calories to build energy, but eating too many and not burning enough of them through physical activity can lead to weight gain. You can always see the calories of food by looking at the label that describes the components of food. </p>
<p>Your body needs some calories just to operate — to keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing.</p>
<p>Watching TV and playing video games won’t burn many calories at all, which is why you should try to limit those activities to 1 to 2 hours per day. A person burns only about 1 calorie per minute while watching TV, about the same as sleeping!</p>
