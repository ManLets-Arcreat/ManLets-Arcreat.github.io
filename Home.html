<h2 id = "TopPage"> REASONS TO EXERCISE</a></h2>
<div class="reason">
    <p><b>There are multiple reasons to exercise. You can add more years to your life and you will feel even better! Even better than sitting down playing video games all day!</b></p>
</div>

<br><br>

<div class="advantage">
    <h3>1. Exercise Controls Weight</h3>
    <p> Exercise can help you control your weight and help you lose weight. Partaking in any physical activity can help you burn calories. More intense activities will burn more calories!</p> 
    <br>

    <h3>2. Exercise Combats Health Conditions and Diseases</h3>
    <p>  No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides.</p> 
    <p>Regular Exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including: </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Stroke</li>
    <li>Metabolic Syndrome</li>
    <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
    <li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Anxiety</li>
    <li>Many Times of Cancer</li>
    <li>Arthritis</li>
    <li>Falls</li>
</ol>

    <p>Notice that you can manage depression and anxiety. It means exercise can also put you in a good mood from time to time. Which brings us to the next reason on why you should exercise! </p>

    <h3>3. Exercise Improves Mood</h3>
    <p>  Physical Activity Stimulates many brain chemicals that may help you feel happier about yourself, makes you more relaxed and less anxious about many things. </p> 

    <p> There is also a saying that you can boost your confidence and self-esteem when you exercise frequently, because it makes you feel better about appearance and you overall self.

     <h3>4. Exercise Boosts Energy </h3>
    <p>  As counterintuitive as it is, exercising boosts your energy. The reasoning behind this is that regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. That's a reason why atheletes seem to never run out of breath during extreme exercise sessions. </p> 

    <p>Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently.</p>

    <h3>5. Exercise Improves Sleep</h3>
    <p>  Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster because it gets you tired, and it's better than consuming blue light before bed! Just don't exercise close to bedtime because exercise can boost your energy (see number 4)!  </p> 

    <h3>6. Exercise Imrpoves... Your sex life...</h3>
    <p>  You can prevent erectile dysfunction...   </p> 
    <p>  Jokes aside, since exercise give you more confidence about your physical appearance, it may boost your sex life.   </p> 

    <h3>7. Exercise can improve your social life</h3>
    <p>  Physical Activity can be fun. Enjoy the outdoors, have a change of pace from the digital space, and is even fun when done with other people you know!    </p>

        SMART WORKOUT
    </h2>
<div class="smart">
    

    <h3 style="color: black;">Below is the SMART diagram. While exercise is not generally part of academics it is still important to follow some standards in order to meet certain goals. This is only applicable if you are setting a goal for your future exercise regiment! </h3>
    <img src="images/SMART.png" width="500px">

    <p>Specific - The goals need to be specific, clear, and concise. A plan that is too broad will make it harder to follow.</p>
    <p>Measurable - Make sure your goal is not too vague and is quantifiable. The progress needs to be measureable in order to monitor the progress.</p>
    <p>Attainable - The goal is attainable and is realistic to follow. Setting goals beyond your capibilities will likely discourage you from continuing with your plan.</p>
    <p>Relevant - Your exercise needs to be relevant to your goals. If you want to increase your strength and the amount of things you can carry without losing too much energy then you should take strength exercises.</p>
    <p>Timely - Setting a realistic time to start and end the plan.</p>
